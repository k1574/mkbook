# mkbook

mkbook - mkfile to make book from files that contain separated chapters.


## Description

The root directory of book contains chapters in
[chapter number].[chapter name] format.

You can use any text format you like:
 * roff
 * markdown
 * plain text


## Why

The point of creating this was that I hate moving
chapters "by hand". So now I can be concentrated
on writing just one chapter.
